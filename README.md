# Computer-Vision
This is a list of projects in Computer Vision (CV).
I initially started with the [Canny Edges](canny2.py) project.
After consideration, then I will start crafting the CV topic from scratch.
1. [Import](import_image.py) an image and print the shape. In addition, we can find out the height and the width of the image and save it with a particular name.
2. [Convert a color image to grayscale](grayscale.py) using cvtColor. Additionally, we can figure out individual color in 3D array of a color image and a 2D array with one value of a grayscale image.
3. Show an image using [HSV](hsv.py) for the color space.
