# Computer-Vision
This is a list of projects in Computer Vision (CV).
I initially started with the [Canny Edges](canny2.py) project.
After consideration, then I will start crafting the CV topic from scratch.
1. [Import](import_image.py) an image and print the shape. In addition, we can find out the height and the width of the image and save it with a particular name.
2. [Convert a color image to grayscale](grayscale.py) using cvtColor. Additionally, we can figure out individual color in 3D array of a color image and a 2D array with one value of a grayscale image.
3. Show an image using [HSV](hsv.py) for the color space.
4. Use  OpenCV's split function to [split](split.py) the image into each color index.
5. Utilize [histogram](histogram.py) to visualize individual color components.
6. Draw images and shapes. Starts by making a black [square](drawing-shape.py), then creates a [diagonal](draw-line.py) line. By knowing that, then we can create basic [rectangle](rectangle.py) and [circle](circle.py). Furthermore, we can add several points and connect them to be a [Polyline](polylines.py).
7. We can create [text](text.py) using cv2.putText. Additionally, we can define the starting point, the font type, size, color, and thickness.
8. Next, learn how to shift the position of an image using [translation](translation.ipynb). *This translation file uses an ipynb file in order to allow readers to simply run it on Google colab.
9. Following that, we will learn how to [rotate](rotate.ipynb) a picture.
